# Enlightenment & EFL

## Updated mirror ‚≠ê

This is the Enlightenment & EFL **mirror** of their repositories, use it only to make some of your things easier for github users like forking, referencing a code, etc. **For everything else** you should use the official repositories which are located on [their Gitea website](https://git.enlightenment.org/)

This is the Enlightenment window-manager desktop by the Enlightenment Foundation Libraries (EFL) and also some extra applications

If there's any repository missing, you can request to add it filling up an issue / discussion :)

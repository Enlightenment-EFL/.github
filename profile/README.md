# Enlightenment & EFL

## Updated mirror ‚≠ê

This is the Enlightenment window-manager desktop by the Enlightenment Foundation Libraries (EFL) and also some extra applications

**Important**: the official git and sources codes are available in [their official Gitea](https://git.enlightenment.org/), this is just an updated mirror of the original source code created to make some things a little easier with the people familiaried with github

If there's any repository missing, you can request to add it filling up an issue :)
